# Latest Notes
- The program/code relies on the difference in the red color of a selected zone when fishing.
As such, fishing rods with red bobbers work the best, as they create the biggest difference when going below water.

# How to use as is

### Download the binaries 
TODO

### Building

To build the project yourself, you require .NET Framework 4.7.2.

# Motivation for making the project

Fishing in Terraria probably the most tedious bit the game offers.

# Using the code

A transparent overlay in the top left corner will be displayed, containing instructions about which numpad keys to use for what.
The overlay does not contain all of the possible interactions.

Press Num4 to activate the mouse and keyboard hook.

Press Num5 to start selecting an area with your mouse and Num5 again to create a rectangle.

Press F when the zone is ready and the fishing rod bobber is in the water.

# TODOs

- Code style improvements (written when I was just learning about platform invocation, threading, ...)
- Perf. improvements with the screen capture
- Documentation
- Customizability of keybindings
- Greater customizability of runtime behavior
